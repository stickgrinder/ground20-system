# Playing the game

## Core mechanic

Ground20 is a pure d20 game. This means that you only need a single d20 to play the game. No other polyedrical dice typical of well renown d20 ancestors will be rolled.

Die rolls every time the outcome of a character action may lead to relevant consequences in the game world.  
In other words, when failure or success mark a difference in the game fiction, a roll is called. Tiying your shoes does not call for a roll, unless you are doing it in a rush, falling from an aircraft and they are levitating shoes that must be firmly strapped to your feet.

When a roll is called, simply roll a d20, adding any relevant bonus to the result. IF you tie or exceed a certain threshold, you succeed. If you fall behind the threshold you fail.

## Thresholds

There are two general kind of thresholds in Ground20.

* Opposed rolls
* Difficulty class

## Opposed rolls

An opposed roll is called when two active entities (a PC and a NPC or monster or artificial intelligence... you name it) are performing opposed actions, or racing for the same outcome.

Playing chess, diving to grab a gun before the opponent, running a race or fighting are all examples of opposed rolls.

In this case the highest result wins. On a tie, player character always win. When the opposed roll happens among two player characters, on a tie the character with the highest base ability bonus wins. On a perfect tie they are in a stale and they must either roll with fiction whenever possible (example: both grab the gun and are now in a grapple) or roll dice again (example: playing chess).
The players may rule that both character lose, if they feel this does for an even grater fiction.

## Difficulty class

A roll against difficulty class (DC from now on) is called when an active entity (usually a PC but GM can roll for NPC if the result adds to drama) is performing an action against an inactive object or situation.

Picking a lock, kicking a door open, recalling something from old memories, understanding a strict dialect are examples of DC rolls. Matching or exceeding the DC means the character succeeds.

To help GMs come out with a fair difficulty class, two reference tables are provided.

### Action-based DC

Refer to this table every time the character attempts an action, leaving the outcome implicit.

This is the case for most mundane action, like leaping over a small chasm, lifting a weight, trying to charm an audience with music, knotting a rope, etc.

// TABLE

### Outcome-based DC

Refer to this table every time the character declares an outcome, leaving the action implicit (or not).

This is the case for most non-mundane or complex action, like casting a spell, declaring a truth about the game world ("I know a person there"), hacking a system, coming up with ... //TODO.
