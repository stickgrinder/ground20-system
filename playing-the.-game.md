# Playing the game

## Table authority

Ground20 games follow the _ruling over rules_ approach, which means that it requires a rule-light system that supports d20-style games, but leaves the interpretation of the rules, and possibly the introduction of more rules, to the users.

The entity that rules what's not in the game rules is called **Table Authority** (also TA).

In classical d20 game, this entity is always the GM. Ground20 also requires a GM to run the game, with the role of facilitator, NPCs player and player challenger, but the GM is not always the TA.

When you start your Ground20 game you as a group must decide whom the TA is. Common choices are:

* The GM: in the most classical fashion, the GM is invested with the honor and duty to rule the table.
* The group: most recent RPGs often propose a _rule by consensus_ formula. If the groups is more keen to interactive fiction or co-narration this may be a lot of fun.

But other uncommon choices can be freely taken as long as everybody at the table is ok with them: per-session round-robin, delegating the _rule lawyer_, flipping a coin or playing rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock... you name it.

Just be aware that **derivative games can impose more restrictive rules than what Ground20 provides as a basis.  
Ground20 may be directly used as a game system, with a minimum effort to skin it, but when it forms the base of a derivative game, the game rules always overrides Ground20 in case of conflict.

## Core mechanic

Ground20 is a pure d20 game. This means that you only need a single d20 to play the game. No other polyedrical dice typical of well renown d20 ancestors will be rolled.

Die rolls every time the outcome of a character action may lead to relevant consequences in the game world.  
In other words, when failure or success mark a difference in the game fiction, a roll is called. Tiying your shoes does not call for a roll, unless you are doing it in a rush, falling from an aircraft and they are levitating shoes that must be firmly strapped to your feet.

When a roll is called, simply roll a d20, adding any relevant bonus to the result. IF you tie or exceed a certain threshold, you succeed. If you fall behind the threshold you fail.

## Thresholds

There are two general kind of thresholds in Ground20.

* Opposed rolls
* Difficulty class

## Opposed rolls

An opposed roll is called when two active entities (a PC and a NPC or monster or artificial intelligence... you name it) are performing opposed actions, or racing for the same outcome.

Playing chess, diving to grab a gun before the opponent, running a race or fighting are all examples of opposed rolls.

In this case the highest result wins. On a tie, player character always win. When the opposed roll happens among two player characters, on a tie the character with the highest base ability bonus wins. On a perfect tie they are in a stale and they must either roll with fiction whenever possible (example: both grab the gun and are now in a grapple) or roll dice again (example: playing chess).
The players may rule that both character lose, if they feel this does for an even grater fiction.

## Difficulty class

A roll against difficulty class (DC from now on) is called when an active entity (usually a PC but GM can roll for NPC if the result adds to drama) is performing an action against an inactive object or situation.

Picking a lock, kicking a door open, recalling something from old memories, understanding a strict dialect are examples of DC rolls. Matching or exceeding the DC means the character succeeds.

Every time the TA defines
To help GMs come out with a fair difficulty class, two reference tables are provided.

### Action-based DC

Refer to this table every time the character attempts an action, leaving the outcome implicit.

> John: "I want to shot an arrow and pin the royal banner to the wall before it falls to the ground."
> GM: "OK, let's try a Fight check... it is very far and that banner won't be larger than a scarf... you must beat DC 25 to succeed!"
> John: "I have the _Shoot_ speciality, may I take advantage from it?"
> GM: "Sure!"

This is the case for most mundane action, like leaping over a small chasm, lifting a weight, trying to charm an audience with music, knotting a rope, etc.  
Most _classic_ d20 games only consider this kind of check, leaving other kind of checks to specific rules (magic, feats, etc).

// TODO: TABLE based on mundane, intuitive difficulty

### Outcome-based DC

Refer to this table every time the character declares an outcome, wether or not she is leaving the action implicit.

> Jane: "I want to damage their drone starship so that it will explode as soon as it makes its first hyperjump!"
> John: "Hey, if you manage to make this drone explode nobody will ever get the message for the rebels... we can consider them unaware of what's happening here!
> Jane: "Yep! That was the plan!"
> GM: "Uhmmm, this would make for a big change, so it is a big challenge! How do you plan to accomplish this deed?"
> Jane: "Well, I'll have to create an energy bottleneck that will somehow overload the engine. Is it something I can do since I'm a _space engineer that wants to stop terrorists from killing more innocents_?
> GM: "Sounds good... Consider the stake is high and it will be very difficult to make it work. What about your _Prodigy_ rank? If you have _Control_ speciality it would give you an advantage."
> Jane: "I have the _Control_ speciality but my _Prodigy_ rank is only 5... if I may apply my descriptor I will have more chances since we are at level 12."
> GM: "Is everybody OK with applying Kandra's descriptor to this check? Yes? OK Kandra, the table authority consider you a great engineer it seems. Hope you know what you are doing, nobody wants that stuff to blow up before it exits the athmosphere, right?"
> Jane: "*glom*... don't think so..."

Outcome-based checks are called for most non-mundane or complex action, like casting a spell, declaring a truth about the game world ("I know a person there"), hacking a system, sabotage a starship's engine.  
The focus here is on the outcome from a fictional point of view. This approach comes from more recent game system like the so called _Powered by the Apocalypse_ line or similar ones. The action must be deemed more difficult, the more the outcome impacts on the game world: performing a ritual to summon a Great Old One so that it crashes the Nazi Reich overnight should never be trivial; entertaining childrens with small magic tricks may not even require to roll dice if this is not meant to impact the world in other ways.

// TODO: TABLE based on impact on game world

> **Gaming Tip** In your game you can rule only one of these two checks exist. Actions-based checks make for a more "classic" gameplay, while Outcome-based lean more towards the modern narative take. Still it's important to notice that Ground20 provides both to help the GM or TA to regulate those situations where mundane experience, logic or inference is not enough to find agree upon legitimacy and/or likelihood.
> So if you want to avoid arguments at the table treat non mundane checks based on the impact they will have (or are expected to have) on fiction and game world.

## Conflicts

Conflict always happen as opposed roll.

Each character check is determined by the action she is attempting. For example: slashing a foe with a sword is a _Fight_ check (_Blades_ apply). Avoiding a raygun blow with a double somersault is a _Athletic_ check (_Acrobatics_ apply).

There is no pre-defined rules on which checks is involved in conflicts. As long as the TA deems a specific skill apt for the action description, it is OK.

## Damage

Damage tracking is done by removing points from a predefined pool.

```
TBD
* How many points?
* Do they change with CON (or other stat)?
* What happens when points are over?
```

Ground20 only consider _Physical_ damage, in the tradition of d20 games. Still GMs and game designers willing to implement other sort of damage trackings (reputation, mental sanity, psychic... whatever) are encouraged to use the same framework explained at paragraph [Damage management framework](#damage-management-framework) below.

### Taking damage

Characters can take damage by losing conflicts, failing checks in threatening situations or suffering illness, poisoning or other sort of enduring negative effects.

When damage is dealt by violence (fight, brawl, grapple, throwing, etc), just subtract the damage indicated in the weapon used from the damage points pool of the character who fails the opposed roll. If no opposed roll is involved (unaware opponent), subtract the weapon damage, taken by the weapon desription (or for quick games, reference the table below).

When damage is suffered by mean of illness or poisoning, refere to the table below to fin the.

When damage is suffered passively (a severe fall, ...) reference

```
TBD: table for opposed damage

TBD: table for continuated damage

TBD: table for passive damage
```

### Tracking damage



### Reducing damage

Damage can be reduced wearing protections (mundane or supernatural, it doesn't matter). An armor will reduce a number of damage points per single blow equal to its Armor Class (AC) value.

Shields are weapons with a AC rating. You can reduce damage by a Shield AC only when you are actively using _Fight_ skill to defend yourself (_Defense_ applies). If not, a shield is of little use.

### Recovering from damage

### Out of action character

When the damage pool is reduced to zero or below, the character is said to be taken _out of action_ (OOE).
Usually this means she's dead, but you can fit this to the mood of your game.

Game designers, GM and ultimately the TA can rule about the meaning of OOE, with the following notable exception: a player may **always** rule her OOE character is dead if she so desires. Not the other way around though.

### Damage management framework

If your game :

* **Basic ability**: Choose an ability which modifier is added (or subtracted) from the base _damage point_ pool at character creation.
* **Damage points pool**: Size the base _damage point_ pool for your game. Good values are:
  * 10 points for Heroic games
  * 20 points for Epic games
  * 20 points + (_Character level_ times the _Basic ability modifier_) for Legendary games
* **Taking, Reducing and Recovery from damage**: Explain what affects this particular _Damage points_ pool and how
* **Out of action characters**: Explain what happens when a character's damage point pool is reduced to zero
* **Creating a set of weapons that fit your game and style**: If you want you can create a set of weapons, with description and special properties, taking the following as a reference
  * Light damage, 2 point: unarmed fist, throwing a rock, falling from a chair, etc
  * Severe damage, 4 points: martial artist unarmed strikes, hitting someone with a wooden staff, cutting through or pircing someone skin
  * Heavy
  * Critical
