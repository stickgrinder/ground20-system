# Player Characters

## Descriptor

Each character is freely described by a statement following this format:

> _Character name_ is a _archetype_ that _goal_. S/He _do something cool_ by feat of his/er _special gift_.

The descriptor helps playing in character and sustains the fictional avatar beside the mere mechanics component.  
In addition, when the descritor applies to a check or during a scene, player can always roll with a rank equal to _character level + 3_, even if she has no skills that apply.

_Example_: **Joe is a racing car pilot that wants to unmask evel plots of the racing mafia. He can make his car leap like a tiger by feat of a special device installed under the vehicle.**

Should Joe get involved in a car chase, while driving a stolen taxi. He can surely apply his descriptior to the scene. As long as driving and car stunts is involved Joe rolls with his level+3 as a skill rank.

Mind that no driving/piloting skills appears in Ground20 skills list. That's what descriptor is there for: filling gaps.
