# Player Characters

## Descriptor

Each character is freely described by a statement following this format:

> _Character name_ is a _archetype_ that _goal_. S/He _do something cool_ by feat of his/er _special gift_.

The descriptor helps playing in character and sustains the fictional avatar beside the mere mechanics component.  
In addition, when the descritor applies to a check or during a scene, player can always roll with a rank equal to _character level + 3_, even if she has no skills that apply.

_Example_: **Joe is a racing car pilot that wants to unmask evel plots of the racing mafia. He can make his car leap like a tiger by feat of a special device installed under the vehicle.**

Should Joe get involved in a car chase, while driving a stolen taxi. He can surely apply his descriptior to the scene. As long as driving and car stunts is involved Joe rolls with his level+3 as a skill rank.

Mind that no driving/piloting skills appears in Ground20 skills list. That's what descriptor is there for: filling gaps.

Feats represent things your character excel into, be it for natural talent, remarkable training, or access to  extraordinary sources of knowledge and power.

Each character gain one feat every level. The same feat can be taken more than once: at times you can stack the grant bonus; other times you must chose some other aspect of your character to apply the talent to.

## Talented

Chose a speciality. You can always take 10 to checks on that speciality, even under pressure. You can apply this feat twice to the same speciality so that you can always take 20, even under pressure.

## Specialist

Chose a speciality you are not trained into. When GM calls a check on that speciality, you always roll with advantage or ignore a disadvantage, if it applies. You must select a different speciality each time you select this feat.
